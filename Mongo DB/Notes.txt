Mongo DB Course

RDBMS(Traditional DB) Relational Database uses notion of databases separated into tables where each column represents a field and each row represents a record.
example: Microsoft Excel, Microsoft access 

Tables can be related with each other with the use of Foreign keys(Common columns)

Normalization

1NF - No repeating elements or group of elements
2NF - No partial dependencies on a concatenated key
3NF - No dependencies on non-key attributes

ACID Properties - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation , Durability

Atomicity - either all parts of db has to be completed or none
Consistency - integrity of db in preserving all transactions 
Isolation - When a transaction must be run isolated in order to gurantee that any inconsistency does not effect other transactions
Drability - when the changes made by a completed transaction must be preserved in that particular db

Limitations of RDBMS
1) Scalability - Scale - up , single server with 8GB RAM scaling it up to 32 GB RAM, when you cannot upgrade that is a limitation and distributed computing, 
for 1000 servers etc, maintenance becomes difficult
2) Data Complexity - unstructured data like music files, images,xml,emails,videos,likes of fb, etc when these increase complexity of data becomes more in RDBMS
3) Broken Keys - bcoz of 1st 2 issues there are key issues
4) Define schema before load - schema has to be defined in RDBMS

NO SQL DB - Non Traditional DB (Also known as Not Only SQL)

SQL No SQL differences
SQL                                                                            No SQL
1) SQL DBs are table based (rows,columns)                        No SQL DB's are graph,key value pairs,document,column stores based etc
2) Vertically Scalable                                           Horizontally Scalable
3) SQL DB's use SQL language
Structured Query Language for defining and manipulating data     Queries are focused on collection of documents
4) SQL,MYSQL,Oracle etc                                          MongoDB,Redis,Cassandra,HBase,Neo4J
5) For Complex queries it is useful                              For Complex queries it is not so useful 


NO SQL Advantages
1) Non-Relational / Distributed DB's 
2) No Schema Required
3) Auto Elasticity
4) Integrated Caching
5) Simpler Data Model

Volume,Variety,Velocity,Value,Veracity - characteristics of No SQL

4 main characteristics of No SQL
1) Data increases continuously 
2) Data is both structured/unstructured
3) Difficult to analyze with a certain tolerable time limit 

No SQL - Document based DB - they allow deep nesting,document within a doc withing doc and so on - example: Mongo DB
       - Key/Value - word-meaning(s) used for quickly storing basic info which are done after performing CPU computation - example: Mongo DBRedis,MemcacheD
       - Column  - bigtable,dynamo db - example:Cassandra, HBase
       - Graph -  different operational modes,java graph based,used for handling complex info - example:OrientDB, Neo4J

Radical Difference: It allows you to store related items in one row in the same table, this row is not same as RDBMS

Lack of Scalability in RDBMS for OLTP Applications/or any with lot of writes.

Data Integrity at all levels.

Differences

RDBMS                                                                        Mongo DB 
1) normal db                                                             Document based
2) tables                                                                Collections
3) records/rows                                                          documents/objects
4) column/attribute                                                      field
5) Join                                                                  Embed/Link Documents

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A single instance of Mongo DB can hold multiple dbs
Every document has a special key "_id"  -> unique to collection
java script shell

Document - key and associated value

example: ("MFD": "Welcome to this course")
          Key        Value
